Simple python script to visualise secondary structures as a single SVG image.

Uploaded as a matter of convenience. There are a couple of examples for shorter proteins. However, using a protein sequence that is too large will break the SVG length limitations. I think the maximum width is some factor of 2 like 32K.

There is no citation request for this one.
